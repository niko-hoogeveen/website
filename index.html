                <p>
                    It all started during the Great SOL FOMO of 2025. Rumors spread like wildfire that Coinbase was running out of Solana. 
                    In the midst of frantic refreshes, meme overload, and degens trying to snipe every last SOL, a lightbulb moment struck a small band of crypto rebels:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If we're all gonna miss out, why not meme it into reality?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, SOL'D OUT ($SOLD) was born. Part tongue-in-cheek homage, part rallying cry for everyone who ever felt the sting of missing out on the next big thing, 
                    $SOLD celebrates the collective chaos of crypto—where the hype, the memes, and the community always come together to create the next unexpected legend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Coinbase “sold out” of Solana, we took it as a challenge. Why not launch something that captures that blink-and-you’ll-miss-it spirit of crypto? With $SOLD, 
                    we’re embracing the madness, building a community that turns scarcity into celebration, and proving once again that if you can’t beat the FOMO—own it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to SOL’D OUT. The meme coin that was born to be unavailable—until you decide to snap it up. Get in before we’re truly…well, sold out.

                    The Coinbase nearly lost its mind when $TRUMP coin crashed through the scene, users buying Solana were sidelined from one of the most hype exchanges in SOL's history.
                    Who knew the biggest threat to your beloved SOL would be a meme coin from Giga Chad Trumpster himself? Yet out of that perfect storm, a new hero emerged: SOL’D OUT $SOLD.
