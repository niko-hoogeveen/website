							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Niko Hoogeveen, a recent graduate from the
								Stephen Smith School of Engineering at Queen's University, specializing in Computer Engineering.
								With a passion for coding, problem-solving, and critical thinking, I'm on a mission to kickstart my career in software engineering.
							<br><br>
								During my time at Queen's University, I honed my skills in various programming languages
								such as C, C++, Python, Java, and more. But it wasn't just about learning languages;
								it was about applying problem-solving knowledge in a diverse . One of my proudest
								accomplishments was co-creating "PantryPal," a recipe generation app developed during a
								Hackathon event. This app allows users to effortlessly whip up meals based on ingredients
								they have at home, showcasing my ability to innovate and collaborate under pressure.
							<br><br>
								Beyond the classroom, I've embraced diverse experiences, from serving with the Canadian
								Coast Guard Inshore Rescue Boat Service to tutoring fellow students in mathematics and computer science.
								These roles have not only sharpened my technical abilities but also instilled in me the
								value of effective communication, teamwork, and leadership â€“ qualities I bring to every aspect of my life.
							<br><br>
								When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me indulging my adventurous
								spirit through kite-surfing, downhill skiing, or hitting the trails on my mountain bike.
								Whether I'm shredding lines of code or carving through fresh powder, I thrive on challenges
								and opportunities for growth.
							<br><br>
								Join me as I embark on this exciting journey in the realm of software engineering,
								fueled by curiosity, determination, and a drive to innovate. Let's connect
								and create something extraordinary together!
