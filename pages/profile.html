				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Niko Hoogeveen, a recent graduate from the
					Stephen Smith School of Engineering at Queen's University, specializing in Computer Engineering.
					With a passion for coding, problem-solving, and critical thinking, I'm on a mission to kickstart my career in software engineering.
					<br><br>
					During my time at Queen's University, I honed my skills in various programming languages
					such as C, C++, Python, Java, and more. But it wasn't just about learning languages;
					it was about applying problem-solving skills to a wide range of engineering problems. One of my proudest
					accomplishments was co-creating "PantryPal," a recipe generation app developed during a
					Hackathon event. This app allows users to effortlessly whip up meals based on ingredients
					they have at home, showcasing my ability to innovate and collaborate under pressure.
					<br><br>
					Beyond the classroom, I've embraced diverse experiences, from serving with the Canadian
					Coast Guard Inshore Rescue Boat Service to tutoring fellow students in mathematics and computer science.
					These roles have not only sharpened my technical abilities but also instilled in me the
					value of effective communication, teamwork, and leadership â€“ qualities I bring to every aspect of my life.
					<br><br>
					When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me indulging my adventurous
					spirit through kite-surfing, downhill skiing, or hitting the trails on my mountain bike.
					Whether I'm shredding lines of code or carving through fresh powder, I thrive on challenges
					and opportunities for growth.
					<br><br>
					Join me as I embark on this exciting journey in the realm of software engineering,
					fueled by curiosity, determination, and a drive to innovate. Let's connect
					and create something extraordinary together!

				<h2>Relevant Projects and Experience</h2>
				<p>In this section, I've highlighted the most important projects that have contributed to my
					technical growth since I started developing. </p>

						<h3>Cactus App</h3>
						<p>Cactus is a rewards program geared towards small to medium-sized businesses. Users can download the app,
							sign-up and start collecting points at local businesses immediately. This app is a project I'm currently working on
							with some peers from Queen's University. The Cactus team has not yet launched the live product, but we are in the midst of development.</p>
						<p>Please feel free to check out our concept website, and stay posted on our official launch!</p>

						<h3>Course Project: Programming Language Processors (CMPE 458) </h3>
						<p>Project consisted of implementing a compiler for a brand-new programming
							language called Quby - created by the course professor. Quby was a modern language that borrowed features from the Ruby
							language and from the Pascal successor language Turing. In the project, we implemented
							Quby by modifying and extending each of the four phases of the existing PT Pascal compiler.
							<br><br>
							This project was one of the hardest undertakings I've completed in my coding career thus far, and I learned a great deal,
							not only about compilers, but also about the value of persistence, communication, and consistency in a project. The project ran over the course
							of the entire term, and required many hours of poring over the existing PT Pascal compiler to properly modify and extend its
							functionality to the Quby language. The project certainly would not have gone successfully without proper commitment from myself or my team members.
							<br><br>

						<h3>Pantry Pal App</h3>
						<p>Pantry Pal was an app created during a hackathon event I participated in with three other students from Queen's. Users can scan
							or add food items to their virtual "Pantry", and the app generates a list of recipes that incorporate the food items in the users pantry.
							The app was created in Android Studio, using spoonacular API to create a list of recipes based on the available ingredients. </p>
						<p>During the hackathon event, I learned a lot about coding under pressure, and working together with a small team to work efficiently in creating the app
							within a short period of time. To learn more about the project, the button below will take to you to the project's source code.</p>
